- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development version.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Vue-infinite-loading. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- It is recommended that you make a JSFiddle/JSBin/Codepen to demonstrate your issue. You could start with [this template](https://jsfiddle.net/PeachScript/qax0dbnc/) that already includes the latest version of Vue-infinite-loading.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.
